# Interest Island üåüüèùÔ∏è
Hello! Thanks for clicking on this repo. üòÅ This project was taken on by me and 3 other friends during summer 2023, where we first started learning about web application development, and signed up for .Hack Enrichment Application Programme 2023 together. Through this project, we learned more about the application of CSS, as well as a bit of JavaScript.

### Project Description
Interest Island aims to bring together likeminded people who want to explore various new activities together. Our primary audience is University students like us, who often find it difficult to find a common timeslot with our friends to go for activities, due to our busy schedules. With this app, users can find others who share the same interest through joining selected group chats, allowing them to then go for activities together, and forge friendships with more likeminded individuals!
